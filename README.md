# Eigen-Computation
This code is used to compute eigen value and eigen vector of an n x n matrices
Eigen value is the characteristic roots of the matrices
Eigen vector is the solution set for the roots.
Libraries to the file is created from the Matlab
Which is converted in to C
And necessary memory allocation is done according to the structures generated as the output of the code generation. 
A step by step procedural video to create neccessary library and how to implement it has been posted in my youtube channel "techii way"
